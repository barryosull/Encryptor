# Encryptor
Playing around with the encryption/decryption libs in PHP.

Nothing special, just wanted to see what could be done with PHP.

This lib contains two scripts. One to encrupt a file, the other to decrypt it.

Issues:
- It asks for encrryption keys in plaintext
    - Need to ask for encrryption keys like a password with the input obfuscated
